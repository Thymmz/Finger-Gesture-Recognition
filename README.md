# Finger-Gesture-Recognition
A project in C, for finger gesture which uses a laser line generator. The camera detects the breakage in line(produced from line genrator) which is read by the camera, and coverted into grayscale. The breakage in the line is counted(1 breakage = 1 finger gesture, 2 breakage = 2 finger gesture and so on). A specified action is done on the basis of the gesture.
